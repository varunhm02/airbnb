As the dataset size was too high we could not upload it on github which has restriction of 50MB per file.

The project consists of three folders:
	classification : SuperHostClassification
	regression: PricePrediction
	One folder: dataset --> listing.csv
Before running the project please place the dataset file listings.csv in each of the two folder mentioned above.
